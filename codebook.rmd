## Project Description
Read in the data from the UCI HAR Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), modify the data to make a dataset, return tidy data in 'tidyData.txt'.

##Study design and data processing
 
###Collection of the raw data
Data was collected from the link:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

###Notes on the original (raw) data 
Some additional notes (if avaialble, otherwise you can leave this section out).
 
##Creating the tidy datafile
 
###Guide to create the tidy data file
1. Download the data
2. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Use descriptive activity names (inactivity_labels.txt) to name the activities in the data set
5. Label the data set with descriptive variable names (in features.txt). 
6. From the data set in step 5, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

###Cleaning of the data
The run_analysis.R script reads in the data from several files and creates a single, tidy data set by concatenating the training and test data, adding the activity labels and features, and saving only the mean and standard deviation columns. The final tidy data reports the mean of each column, for each subject/activity data pair. 
For a more complete description, see https://github.com/cstrope/GCD_Course_Project/edit/master/README.md

##Description of the variables in the tiny_data.txt file
The final tidy data set is 180 rows by 88 columns. 

The data is separated by activity (6 activities, see README) and subject (30 subjects) rows. The remainder of the columns are the mean of each variable with the specified subject/activity pair.

The varible in the columns are as follows:
"tBodyAcc-mean()-X"                    "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y"                   
"tBodyAcc-mean()-Z"                    "tGravityAcc-mean()-X"                
"tGravityAcc-mean()-Y"                 "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z"                
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X"                "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y"               
"tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z"                "tBodyGyro-mean()-X"

General description of the file including:
 - Dimensions of the dataset
 - Summary of the data
 - Variables present in the dataset
 
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
 
###Variable 1 (repeat this section for all variables in the dataset)
Short description of what the variable describes.
 
Some information on the variable including:
 - Class of the variable
 - Unique values/levels of the variable
 - Unit of measurement (if no unit of measurement list this as well)
 - In case names follow some schema, describe how entries were constructed (for example time-body-gyroscope-z has 4 levels of descriptors. Describe these 4 levels). 
 
(you can easily use Rcode for this, just load the dataset and provide the information directly form the tidy data file)
 
####Notes on variable 1:
If available, some additional notes on the variable not covered elsewehere. If no notes are present leave this section out.
 
##Sources
Sources you used if any, otherise leave out.
 
##Annex
If you used any code in the codebook that had the echo=FALSE attribute post this here (make sure you set the results parameter to 'hide' as you do not want the results to show again)
